Key Visualizations & Findings ðŸ“Š
The report includes a variety of interactive visualizations that highlight important trends. Here are some of the key findings you can explore:

Overall Churn Rate: The dashboard immediately shows that 20.4% of the bank's customers have churned.

Demographic Breakdown: Interactive charts break down churn by different customer groups, including gender, country (France, Spain, Germany), credit card status, and active status.

Age and Churn: The analysis reveals that the 41-50 age group has the highest churn rate, a critical insight for targeted retention efforts.

Credit Score and Account Balance: You can see how churn is influenced by both a customer's credit score and their account balance. The dashboard helps visualize the specific ranges where churn is most likely to occur.

Products and Churn: The report also shows the churn rate based on the number of bank products a customer uses, indicating a potential correlation between product usage and loyalty.
